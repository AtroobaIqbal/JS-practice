/*1. Write a program to check whether the given input number is
divisible by 3 or else show a message “Number is not divisible
by 3”.
var divi = +prompt("enter any number which is divisible by 3");
if (divi % 3 === 0) {
    document.write("this number is divisible by 3");
}
else{
    document.write("this number is not divisible by 3");
}

2. Write a program that checks whether the given input is an even
number or an odd number.
var num = +prompt("enter a number");
if (num % 2 === 0) {
    document.write("it is a even number");
}
else {
    document.write("it is a odd number");
}

3. Write an if/else statement with the following condition:
If the variable age is greater than 18, output "Old enough",
otherwise output "Too young".
var age = +prompt("enter your age");
if (age > 18) {
    document.write("old enough");
} else{
    document.write("too young");
}

4. Write a program that prompts the user for their name, and then
displays a special greeting to that person if their name is the
same as yours. If the name entered by the user is anything
other than your name, your code should not produce any
output.
var name = "elsa";
var clName = prompt("enter your name");
if (name === clName) {
    document.write("good luck");
} 

5. Write a program to check whether the given input number is
divisible by 3 or not by using Switch Case statements. Show a
message “Number is not divisible by 3” or “Number is divisible
by 3”.



6. Write a program that takes a character(number or string) in a
variable & checks whether the given input is a number,
uppercase letter or lower case letter. (Hint: ASCII codes:-
A=65, Z=90, a=97, z=122)*/
